# kotlinjs-snake

Building a Snake Game using Kotlin JS. My futile attemp to get better/fluent with Kotlin language.

## Development

Import via Intellij then run via the kotlinjs-run configuration. Edit the configuration within
intellij and add "--continuous" on the Arguments section. This ensures that your browser
gets reloaded whenever you have some changes.

## Next Steps

1. Create a better bot?
2. Try to get an AI trained to play the game.
